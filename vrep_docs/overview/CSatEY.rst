CSim at e-Yantra
****************

CSim has widely been used at e-Yantra in the past. In research projects like developing `ball-balancing tables <http://empty>`_ and `ball-balancing robots <http://empty>`_ to widespread use in themes to teach path-planning and obstacle avoidance [1] [2], control systems [3], and concepts of kinematics and dynamics [4] using various simulated robotic platforms. (REFERENCES REMAIN TO BE ADDED)

However, the widest deployment of CSim at e-Yantra has been to teach concepts of embedded systems and algorithm development using a diferential drive robotics platform which closely replicated the Firebird V robotics research and development platform developed at the Embedded Realtime Systems Lab at IIT-Bombay, which hosts the e-Yantra project. This platform, henceforth referred to as eBot, and an client-side API for interfacing with it were deployed to xyz and lmn teams of 4 students, for a period of 6 weeks each, in the 2019 & 2020 editions of the e-yantra Robotics Competition respectively.

eBot and its ecosystem and developments to them represent the chance to bring the entire process pipeline of the typical training of embedded systems e-Yantra engages in to a simulation platform, unlocking a massive potential for scaling up this delivery of knowledge.

As I the author am the developer and maintainer of eBot & its ecosystem, the present version of this document will largely revolve around them and the various planned improvements.

Before moving to that, let us take a quick look at the various ways C-Sim functionality can be extended within and beyong the application.
