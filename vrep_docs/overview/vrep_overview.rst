CSim Overview
**************

CoppeliaSim (CSim) is a fully-featured, robust, robot simulator. Per the website:

	The robot simulator CoppeliaSim, with integrated development environment, is based on a distributed control architecture: each object/model can be individually controlled via an embedded script, a plugin, a ROS or BlueZero node, a remote API client, or a custom solution. This makes CoppeliaSim very versatile and ideal for multi-robot applications. Controllers can be written in C/C++, Python, Java, Lua, Matlab or Octave.

	CoppeliaSim is used for fast algorithm development, factory automation simulations, fast prototyping and verification, robotics related education, remote monitoring, safety double-checking, as digital twin, and much more. You can find a feature overview here.

An `overview of its features <https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/features>`_ and `videos of development possibilities <https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/videos>`_ can be viewed by clicking on the hyperlinks.

My co-workers at e-Yantra have made a series of videos which are displayed below. Do watch them for a more thorough overview of the simulator. I shall not repeat these topics, but shall briefly describe them whenever we first encounter them in this document.

.. note:: The audio for these videos is recorded at a deliberately slow pace, you can use the playback speed multiplier to increase the playback speed, the content remains understandable. The playlist icon is on the top right of the iframe.
