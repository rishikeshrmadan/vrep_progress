Hello everyone reading this document! I hope you have a fun and productive time engaging in the ecosystem, furthering and improving it.


This document aims to give an overview about developing, deploying and grading e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) themes in simulators. At present the simulator being used is V-REP (now CoppeliaSim (C-Sim as non-standard abbreviation)) due to various advantageous and a couple of now minor legacy reasons. V-REP/C-Sim is the only planned simulator candidate for further improvement of features and functionality in the ecosystem, all efforts will be directed to keep the developed functionality platform-agnostic.

This document will cover the present-state of the ecosystem as of May 2020, aiming to cover all of it's advantages and shortcomings. Hopefully, a development timeline will be created and attached, development has proceeded in short and infrequent spurts, around 3-4 of them. due the various other contingencies and exigencies working at e-Yantra entails.
