1. Overview of V-REP

     a) Use cases
     b) Extensibilty and interfaces 
2. Client side work
     d) API
     f) Advantages
     g) How clients interface with the simulator
3. Developer side work

     a) Arena creation
     b) Automatic Evaluation 
4. Planned Improvements on the Client-side

     a) Interfacing with the e-Yantra circuit simulator
     b) Creating gripper interfaces for better pick and place, all new sensor development closely tied with the above point
     c) Creating a leaderboard for enhanced competition
     d) Creating a user interface to pick and choose between different arenas (Think of like netflix, or more closely steam interfaces)

5. Planned Improvements on the Developer-side

     a) Automatic creation of arenas
     b) Automatic configuration of evaluators
     c) Extensible architecture to incorporate new features in the simulator interface
     d) Robust architecture for all these elements to interface together
     e) UI to create new themes
     f) Auto-solver of these themes to incorporate rapid testing
   
7. Results of this being widely-deployed

9. Beyond simulators
